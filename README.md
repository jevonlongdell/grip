grip
====

*The orignal grip project is alive again. It's a better place to start than here: *

https://sourceforge.net/projects/grip/


This will start of as v3.3.1 of the source code of "grip". A great old cd ripping program that appears abandoned.

To compile on unbuntu 13.10 you want to install the packages
 - lame
 - cdparanoia
 - libcurl4-openssl-dev
 - libgnomeui-dev
 - libvte-dev

or 
> apt-get isntall lame cdparanoia libcurl4-openssl-dev libgnomeui-dev libvte-dev
